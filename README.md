## What is Requirement Analysis?
📌 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages like design, development, testing, and deployment.

In simpler terms, requirement analysis ensures that everyone involved in the project (developers, designers, testers, and clients) has a shared and clear understanding of what the software is supposed to do.

🧱 Stages in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
The SDLC includes the following phases:

Requirement Analysis

System Design

Implementation (Coding)

Testing

Deployment

Maintenance

📍 As the first functional stage, requirement analysis influences every other phase and defines the success or failure of the project.

🎯 Importance of Requirement Analysis
1. Clear Understanding of Stakeholder Needs
Requirement analysis helps uncover the true needs of users and clients. This minimizes miscommunication and ensures that the final product delivers real value.

2. Scope Definition
By defining what the system should and shouldn't do, requirement analysis prevents scope creep—the uncontrolled expansion of project features that can derail timelines and budgets.

3. Foundation for System Design
All system architectures, interfaces, and workflows are built based on documented requirements. Poor or incomplete requirements lead to design flaws.

4. Accurate Cost and Time Estimation
With clear requirements, teams can more accurately estimate the budget, timeline, and resource allocation, reducing the risk of delays and overspending.

5. Quality Assurance
Requirement analysis provides the criteria for validation and testing. If requirements are not clearly defined, it's impossible to verify if the software is functioning correctly.

6. Customer Satisfaction
Well-documented and validated requirements ensure the final product aligns with the customer’s vision, increasing satisfaction and trust.

🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering:

Conducting interviews, surveys, and observations

Analyzing existing systems and documentation

Hosting workshops with stakeholders

Requirement Elicitation:

Extracting true user needs through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping

Requirement Documentation:

Writing functional and non-functional requirements

Creating user stories, use case diagrams, and requirement specification documents

Requirement Modeling:

Using data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and system models to visualize and understand requirements

Requirement Validation:

Reviewing requirements with stakeholders

Defining acceptance criteria

Ensuring traceability (each requirement can be tracked from design to testing)

🛠️ Types of Requirements
⚙️ Functional Requirements:
Define what the system should do, e.g.:

Login system

Booking process

Search functionality

🛡️ Non-Functional Requirements:
Define how the system should behave, e.g.:

Performance (e.g., load time < 2 seconds)

Security (e.g., data encryption)

Usability, scalability, reliability


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. ✅ Establishes a Clear Understanding Between Stakeholders and Developers
Description:
Requirement analysis ensures that all parties—clients, users, project managers, and developers—have a shared and accurate understanding of what the system should do. It reduces ambiguity and misunderstandings.

Why it's critical:
Without clear requirements, developers may build a system that doesn’t meet user needs, leading to rework, dissatisfaction, and wasted resources.

2. 🛑 Prevents Scope Creep
Description:
By clearly defining what features and functions are within the project scope, requirement analysis helps prevent scope creep—the uncontrolled addition of features during development.

Why it's critical:
Scope creep can cause delays, increase costs, and derail the entire project. A well-analyzed requirement set helps teams stay focused on agreed-upon goals.

3. 💰 Improves Cost, Time, and Resource Estimation
Description:
With detailed and validated requirements, project teams can accurately estimate the time, budget, and manpower needed for each development phase.

Why it's critical:
Poor estimation due to unclear requirements often leads to budget overruns, missed deadlines, and inadequate resource allocation.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. 📥 Requirement Gathering
Collects raw information from stakeholders about what they need from the system.

Involves techniques such as:

Interviews with clients and users

Surveys and questionnaires

Workshops for group discussions

Observation of users in their work environment

Document analysis of current systems or processes

Goal: Build a comprehensive list of potential requirements.

2. 🧠 Requirement Elicitation
Focuses on clarifying and refining the information gathered.

Helps uncover hidden, conflicting, or misunderstood needs.

Common techniques include:

Brainstorming sessions to generate ideas

Focus groups with selected stakeholders

Prototyping to help users visualize the product and clarify needs

Goal: Discover the true needs and expectations behind the initial input.

3. 📝 Requirement Documentation
Converts gathered and elicited information into clear, structured, and written form.

Ensures consistency, traceability, and ease of reference throughout the project.

Common documentation formats:

Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents

User stories written from the user's perspective

Use cases and use case diagrams showing interactions between users and the system

Goal: Create a single source of truth for all project requirements.

4. 📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Involves examining and organizing the documented requirements for better understanding and implementation.

Activities include:

Prioritizing requirements based on business value and feasibility

Feasibility analysis to ensure the project is technically and financially doable

Modeling using diagrams like:

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

Process Models or System Architecture Diagrams

Goal: Ensure the requirements are complete, consistent, and realistic.

5. ✅ Requirement Validation
Ensures the documented requirements correctly represent stakeholder needs and are ready for design and development.

Techniques used:

Stakeholder reviews and walkthroughs

Defining acceptance criteria for each requirement

Requirement traceability matrices to ensure coverage in design and testing

Goal: Confirm that requirements are accurate, feasible, and agreed upon by all parties.
