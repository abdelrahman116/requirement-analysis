## What is Requirement Analysis?
📌 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages like design, development, testing, and deployment.

In simpler terms, requirement analysis ensures that everyone involved in the project (developers, designers, testers, and clients) has a shared and clear understanding of what the software is supposed to do.

🧱 Stages in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
The SDLC includes the following phases:

Requirement Analysis

System Design

Implementation (Coding)

Testing

Deployment

Maintenance

📍 As the first functional stage, requirement analysis influences every other phase and defines the success or failure of the project.

🎯 Importance of Requirement Analysis
1. Clear Understanding of Stakeholder Needs
Requirement analysis helps uncover the true needs of users and clients. This minimizes miscommunication and ensures that the final product delivers real value.

2. Scope Definition
By defining what the system should and shouldn't do, requirement analysis prevents scope creep—the uncontrolled expansion of project features that can derail timelines and budgets.

3. Foundation for System Design
All system architectures, interfaces, and workflows are built based on documented requirements. Poor or incomplete requirements lead to design flaws.

4. Accurate Cost and Time Estimation
With clear requirements, teams can more accurately estimate the budget, timeline, and resource allocation, reducing the risk of delays and overspending.

5. Quality Assurance
Requirement analysis provides the criteria for validation and testing. If requirements are not clearly defined, it's impossible to verify if the software is functioning correctly.

6. Customer Satisfaction
Well-documented and validated requirements ensure the final product aligns with the customer’s vision, increasing satisfaction and trust.

🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering:

Conducting interviews, surveys, and observations

Analyzing existing systems and documentation

Hosting workshops with stakeholders

Requirement Elicitation:

Extracting true user needs through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping

Requirement Documentation:

Writing functional and non-functional requirements

Creating user stories, use case diagrams, and requirement specification documents

Requirement Modeling:

Using data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and system models to visualize and understand requirements

Requirement Validation:

Reviewing requirements with stakeholders

Defining acceptance criteria

Ensuring traceability (each requirement can be tracked from design to testing)

🛠️ Types of Requirements
⚙️ Functional Requirements:
Define what the system should do, e.g.:

Login system

Booking process

Search functionality

🛡️ Non-Functional Requirements:
Define how the system should behave, e.g.:

Performance (e.g., load time < 2 seconds)

Security (e.g., data encryption)

Usability, scalability, reliability
